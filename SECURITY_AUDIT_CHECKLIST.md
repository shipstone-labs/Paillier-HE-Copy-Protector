# Security Audit Checklist for Paillier POC with vetKeys

## Overview
This checklist ensures the Paillier POC with vetKeys integration meets security requirements before production deployment.

---

## ‚úÖ vetKeys Implementation

### Key Derivation
- [ ] Verify vetKeys implementation matches latest IC specification
- [ ] Confirm derivation paths prevent key collision between documents
- [ ] Validate key_id usage follows best practices
- [ ] Test derivation path structure: `["document", doc_id]`
- [ ] Ensure deterministic key generation from same inputs

### Key Management
- [ ] Ensure no key material persists in heap memory after use
- [ ] Verify keys are properly zeroized after operations
- [ ] Confirm cache doesn't leak sensitive data on eviction
- [ ] Test that cleared cache cannot be recovered
- [ ] Validate cache TTL (5 minutes) is appropriate

### Fallback Mode
- [ ] Fallback keys are only used when vetKeys unavailable
- [ ] Fallback mode is clearly logged and monitored
- [ ] Fallback keys have sufficient entropy
- [ ] Migration path exists from fallback to vetKeys

---

## üîí Cryptographic Security

### Paillier Implementation
- [ ] **WARNING**: Current SimplePaillier is NOT secure - marked as POC only
- [ ] Document clearly states cryptographic limitations
- [ ] No production data should use this implementation
- [ ] Plan exists for proper Paillier implementation

### Randomness
- [ ] Deterministic "randomness" is documented as insecure
- [ ] No system randomness used (ICP limitation understood)
- [ ] Hash-based entropy mixing is implemented correctly

### Key Sizes
- [ ] 512-bit keys acknowledged as insufficient for production
- [ ] Upgrade path to 2048+ bit keys documented
- [ ] Performance impact of larger keys analyzed

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Access Control

### Owner Permissions
- [ ] Owner principal set correctly on initialization
- [ ] Owner-only functions properly restricted:
  - `clear_all_documents()`
  - `clear_vetkd_cache()`
- [ ] Cannot change owner after initialization

### Input Validation
- [ ] Document IDs restricted to alphanumeric + `_` and `-`
- [ ] Document ID length limited to 64 characters
- [ ] Token size exactly 32 bytes enforced
- [ ] Maximum tokens per document (40) enforced
- [ ] Batch operation size limit (10) enforced

---

## ‚ö° Performance & Limits

### Instruction Limits
- [ ] Safety margin set to 4B instructions (80% of 5B limit)
- [ ] Instruction monitoring every 3-5 tokens
- [ ] Early termination on limit approach
- [ ] Batch operations respect cumulative limits

### Memory Management
- [ ] Document limit (100) prevents memory exhaustion
- [ ] Memory estimation includes BigUint overhead
- [ ] Cache sizes bounded (keys: 100, Paillier: 20)
- [ ] No memory leaks in long-running operations

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Consider implementing per-principal rate limits
- [ ] Monitor for denial-of-service patterns
- [ ] Cache bombardment protection

---

## üîç Error Handling

### Information Disclosure
- [ ] No sensitive data in error messages
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal system internals
- [ ] Timing attacks considered (constant-time where possible)
- [ ] Failed operations properly logged

### Error Recovery
- [ ] Partial encryption failures handled gracefully
- [ ] Inter-canister call failures don't corrupt state
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms for failed operations

---

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

### Security Events
- [ ] All key operations logged with principal
- [ ] Log rotation prevents unbounded growth (1000 events)
- [ ] Security event types comprehensive:
  - Key derivation
  - Cache access
  - Fallback usage
  - Rate limit exceeded
  - Invalid access attempts

### Metrics
- [ ] Performance metrics don't leak sensitive patterns
- [ ] Metrics accessible only through query methods
- [ ] No personally identifiable information in logs

---

## üîÑ Inter-Canister Security

### vetKeys Calls
- [ ] Management canister calls use proper error handling
- [ ] Retry logic doesn't create security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Timeout handling prevents hanging operations
- [ ] Principal validation on all calls

### Call Authentication
- [ ] Caller principal verified for sensitive operations
- [ ] No assumption about caller trustworthiness
- [ ] Replay attack prevention considered

---

## üìù Documentation & Deployment

### Security Documentation
- [ ] All limitations clearly documented
- [ ] "NOT FOR PRODUCTION" warnings prominent
- [ ] Security considerations in API documentation
- [ ] Upgrade path to production version clear

### Deployment Security
- [ ] Deployment scripts don't expose secrets
- [ ] Canister IDs not hardcoded
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations separated
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures documented

---

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Security Testing
- [ ] Fuzzing inputs for crashes/panics
- [ ] Boundary condition testing
- [ ] Concurrent operation safety
- [ ] Upgrade/downgrade path testing

### Penetration Testing
- [ ] Input validation bypass attempts
- [ ] Cache poisoning tests
- [ ] Timing attack analysis
- [ ] Resource exhaustion tests

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Must Fix for Production)

1. **SimplePaillier is insecure** - Requires complete reimplementation
2. **Deterministic randomness** - Needs external randomness beacon
3. **No key rotation** - Implement periodic key refresh
4. **No audit trail persistence** - Store in stable memory
5. **Limited key size** - Upgrade to 2048+ bits
6. **No threshold operations** - Add multi-party support

---

## üìã Audit Sign-off

- [ ] Code review completed by security team
- [ ] Penetration testing performed
- [ ] All high-risk issues addressed
- [ ] Deployment plan reviewed
- [ ] Incident response plan in place
